# NetLab
Virtual lab environment for students &amp; teachers

### Overview

Netlab is a full-stack app implemented with a MERN stack - MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React and Node.
It also uses Firebase for user authentication, profiles & real-time sync of notes. 

You start the app from the command line using "node server.js".

### Purpose

NetLab allows instructors & students to work and collaborate in a virtual lab environment.

Instructors can upload slide sets and add annotations to slides.

Students view & study slides using the virtual microscope, which allows for zooming and panning throughout a tissue, all the way down to the cellular level.

Students can add their own notes to slides, save notes and pin important slide locations for later reference.
